1.download unity34 from unity3d.com/get-unity
2.download JDK (Java Development kit) from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
3.download Android SDK : you don't need to download the Android Studio, so go to SDK Tools Only section and download the zip file appropriate for your OS.
4.unzip the SDK and place the unzipped in a location that makes sense: On a Mac a good place would be /Users/username/Library/Android/sdk.
(Note you have to create the Android directory and the unzipped folder would be the android-sdk).
5.open the SDK manager by going inside the sdk->tools->android. A window will open and you will be asked what Android tools/APIs you want to install.  
6.install at least one of the APIs. The API should be compatible to the device you will be using for testing purposes. 
So for example, my Samsung Galaxy S4 has Android 5.0.1 installed, hence I downloaded API21.
7.Also install the SDK tools. 
8.Open Unity, create a new project/pull an existing project. Go to Unity->Preferences->External Tools and specify the JDK and the SDK location: 
For me these were:
/Users/rudinamorina/Library/Android/android-sdk
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_60.jdk/
9.When developing the project in Unity, make sure the platform selected is Android, not the default PC.
